# TSA-Claims-Analysis

This project aims to cleanse and analyse the Transport Security Agency data which was collected over a 10 year period from 2002-12.

Some questions that are answered are:
-  What percentage of amount claimed in the 10 years was reimbursed by the TSA?
-  What percentage of the number of claims was accepted by the TSA?
-  Top five airports with the largest number of claims and approved claims.
